## Work
Please write a program to perform process scheduling according to the following requirements: 
- The programming language is of your choice.
- It can be run on the Windows operating system.
- It can be executed via the command line using the following syntax: <file_name>.exe <INPUT_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE> 
  -  _For example_: 
    main.exe input.txt output.txt
- The input and output files are both saved in text format (*.txt).
- Syntax of the <INPUT_FILE>:
  - The first line: an integer from 1 to 4 representing the scheduling algorithm
    | # | Scheduling algorithm |
    |----------|----------|
    | 1   | FCFS (First Come First Serve) |
    | 2 | RR (Round Robin) |
    | 3  | SJF (Shortest Job First) |
    | 4 | SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next) |
  -  In case of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, the second line is a positive integer representing the time quantum.
  -  The next line: a positive integer N representing the number of processes to be scheduled, up to maximum of 4 processes.
  -  The following N lines: each line describes the scheduling information of a process with the syntax:
  
        `<Arrival time in Ready Queue>` [`<CPU Burst Time>` `<Resource Usage Time>`]
  -  It is known that:
      -  In the scheduling table, each process can use CPU and R multiple times, but up to a maximum of 3 times for each (CPU/R)
      -  In the scheduling table, a process may complete earlier than other processes. This means that the number of CPU and R usages for each process is different.
      -  The system only has one resource R. The scheduling algorithm on resource R is always FCFS.
      -  Give pripority to new processes in case of conflict in the entrance of Ready Queue.
 
  For example:
  
    -  FCFS/SJF/SRTN
        ```
        1 
        3 
        0 5 3 4 
        1 4 
        2 3 3
        ```
        
        | # | Arrival Time | CPU | R | CPU |
        |---|:------------:|:---:|:-:|:---:|
        | 1 | 0            | 5   | 3 | 4   |
        | 2 | 1            | 4   |   |     |
        | 3 | 2            | 3   | 3 |     |
    -  Round Robin
        ```

        ```
        
        | # | Arrival Time | CPU | R | CPU | R | CPU |
        |---|:-------------:|:---:|---|:---:|---|:---:|
        | 1 | 0             | 5   | 3 | 4   |   |     |
        | 2 | 2             | 4   |   |     |   |     |
        | 3 | 5             | 3   | 3 |     |   |     |
        | 4 | 3             | 6   | 2 | 3   | 8 | 1   |
-  Syntax of the <OUTPUT_FILE>:
    -  The first line: an integer sequence separated by a single whitespace, represents the Gantt chart of the process scheduling on the CPU. Note that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 represent processes P1, P2, P3, P4; and a hyphen ( _ ) denotes the time slot during which no process is using the CPU.
    -  The second line: has a similar structure to the first line, but it represents the scheduling on the resource R.
    -  The third line: an integer sequence separated by a single whitespace, represents the turn-around time of all processes.
    -  The fourth line: an integer sequence separated by a single whitespace, represents the waiting time of all processes.

    For example:
      -  Input:
          ```
          1 
          3 
          0 5 3 4 
          1 4 
          2 3 3 
          ```
     -  Output:
          ```
          1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 
          _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 1 _ _ _ _ 3 3 3 
          16 8 13 
          4 4 7 
          ```
